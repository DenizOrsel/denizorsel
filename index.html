	    <h1>The lab</h1>
	    <p>I have no clue how you ended up here but I hope you enjoy your visit.</p>
	    <h3>So what is this place? And who am I?</h3>
	    <p>This is my lab where I experiment various aspects of development material like javascript,html,css,webgl. I also log my trials on such experiments here.</p>
	    
	    <h3>The, who I am?! part</h3>
	    <p>I am an explorer, keen observer of things I find intriguing, fond of visual interactions, a technologist, a futurist.</p>
	    <p>Provided that,I have been currently residing in Amsterdam,the Legoland and working for <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com" target="_blank" class="btn btn-info btn-xs" role="button">a software company</a> doing several things I enjoy participating.</p>
	    <p>Aside from technology, I like writing, any types of gaming, playing beach volley, football and pool. Chilling at one random coffee house by the canals while watching a tutorial is one thing I enjoy a lot. I also like to play some tunes with my classic guitar thanks to tabs and listen to cool rhytms on web while experimenting.</p>
	    
	    <h3>More details about my background if you are interested</h3>
	    <p>I was born in Istanbul, the city where cultural clash gave birth to most tentalizing atmosphere, and started programming at the age of 8 in BASIC thanks to my dad's enthusiasm about technology. As a child I was more interested in gaming, well naturally, which made me more interested in interactive applications with visual enhancements.</p>
	    <p>I guess it was 1992 when I first logged onto a BBS "Bulletin board service" - a teletext interface - to download some files to improve my English. It got me excited about how those interfaces were created and served and thus I had a couple of interface designs to help our local stock shop to serve something similar for its clients.</p>
	    <p>A couple of years later, I got introduced to a program called 3Ds Realise "nowadays 3DS MaX" by my high school best friend. It was a fascinating experience for me to create 3d objects and simple animations.</p>
	    <p>Internet was wild and virgin back then. I quickly got into the world of web thanks to geocities and xoom (free web hosting platforms back in the day). Macromedia's Flash was the next thing to play with. VRML was cool to integrate 3D with Web. Later I got my full scholarship from Bahcesehir University,TR and one year at San Diego State University,CA US thanks to those applications and my neverending excitement.</p>
	    <p>Having a university discipline on the subjects I always enjoyed playing with, was an amazing experience. Visual Communication Design and Visual Arts is a perfect fit with exclusive new media studies if you want to be a front end & UX oriented person.</p>
	    <p>Design & communication discipline blended with my application and technology experience enabled me to provide the solutions asked, including the installations contented within mainstream bienals in early 2000s.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Change is inevitable. Adaptation, reformation, responsibility are requirements.</h3>
	    <small>As storm clouds shake the ground, piercing it with heavy projectile rain, one shall look for a sturdy shelter.</small>
	    <br>
	    <p> It was when I returned from obligatory military service with financial unrest in the country, I checked in for a stable position in a completely different discipline. Soon I realized I could easily adapt to that new universe. I started processing data for a major market research company for various projects and drastically improved my skills on flat file datasets as well as structured sets while creating logic boards for survey flow. It carried on as, me playing more with visual outputs such as graphs,charts,tables where data became visible.</p>
	    <p>Becoming an expert on Transact SQL, an exclusive scripting language called ODIN, and SPSS Statistics by IBM has lit my path to where I stand now while online survey setups required me to invest heavily further on web dynamics.</p>
	    <small>As a professional, I learnt that change may not be avoided. So one needs to adapt the change. For that, one needs to keep fit in what he or she does by constant reformation along the way. And that is the responsibility a professional must have.</small>
	    <br>
	    <p>In the current situation, I would like to address the process of reformation in this lab by the experiments I will actively execute. I guess this is all there is to it which has given me the reason to create the lab.</p>
