	    <h1>Lab101</h1>
	    <p>I have no clue how you ended up here but I hope you enjoy your visit.</p>
	    <h3>So what is this place? And who am I?</h3>
	    <p>This is my lab where I experiment various aspects of development material like javascript,html,css,webgl. I also log my trials on such experiments here.</p>
	    <h3>Who I am part</h3>
	    <p>I am an explorer, keen observer of things I find intriguing, fond of visual interactions, a technologist, a futurist.</p>
	    <p>Provided that,I have been currently residing in Amsterdam,the Legoland and working for <a href="http://www.niposoftware.com" target="_blank" class="btn btn-info btn-xs" role="button">a software company</a> doing several things I enjoy participating.</p>
	    <p>Aside from technology, I like writing, any types of gaming, playing beach volley, football and pool. Chilling at one random coffee house by the canals while watching a tutorial is one thing I enjoy a lot.</p>
	    <h3>More details about my background if you are interested</h3>
	    <p>I was born in Istanbul,TR and started programming at the age of 8 in BASIC thanks to my dad's enthusiasm about technology. As a child I was more interested in gaming, well naturally, which made me more interested in interactive applications with visual enhancements.</p>
	    <p>I guess it was 1992 when I first logged onto a BBS "Bulletin board service" - a teletext interface - to download some files to improve my English. It got me excited about how those interfaces were created and served and thus I had a couple of interface designs to help our local stock shop to serve something similar for its clients.</p>
	    <p>A couple of years later, I got introduced to a program called 3Ds Realise "nowadays 3DS MaX" by my best friend in high school. It was fascinating for me to create 3d objects and simple animations.</p>
	    <p>Internet was wild and virgin back then. I quickly got into the world of html,sgml to experiment website creation. Macromedia's Flash was the next thing to play with. VRML was cool to integrate 3D with Web. Later I got my full scholarship from Bahcesehir University and one year at San Diego State University thanks to those applications.</p>
	    <p>Having a university discipline on the subjects I always enjoyed playing with was an amazing experience. Visual Communication Design and Visual Arts is a perfect fit with exclusive new media studies if you want to be a front end & UX oriented person.</p>
